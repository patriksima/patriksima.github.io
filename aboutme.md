Ammo for small talk.

I'm interested in finance, management, investments, stocks, loans, economics, gaming industry and art.

I'm an active trader, hobby game developer, designer and investor.

I'm learner and innovator. (See [my CliftonStrengths Report PDF](/assets/pdf/CliftonStrengths%20_%20Gallup%20Access.pdf))

I'm also father of two and beloved husband. I love travelling the world.
