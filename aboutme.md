## The Short Version

I'm a senior .NET developer with 20+ years in IT, father of two, hobby game developer, certified chess coach, and a person with probably too many past lives for one lifetime.

## How It All Started

My journey into tech began in childhood at a church school where they had a PMD computer. I have no idea how I ended up in front of it, but I did. Then my grandfather bought me a [**Didactic M**](https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/Didaktik_M) – I still remember reading the Slovak manual (probably my first Slovak book ever).

I taught myself **assembly language** and tried creating games, but lacked the knowledge back then. When the Pentium PC era arrived in '95, I dove into low-level stuff – experimenting with viruses, learning C, getting into Novell NetWare. The atmosphere of the **Invex exhibitions in Brno** captivated me completely – the internet, BBS boards, the hacker, cracker, and demoscene culture. I've been hooked ever since.

## What I Love About My Work

**Variety.** There's always something new. I enjoy optimization problems, the creative process from coding to 3D modeling in Blender, even writing short stories. I like building things from scratch and making them work well.

## Currently Learning

- 📚 **Master's degree** in Process Management at VŠEM
- 🇷🇺 **Russian** on Duolingo (daily streak keeper)
- 🇬🇧 Constantly improving my **English**
- ♟️ **Chess** – playing daily, at least online

---

## Side Projects

I'm working on a **survival game in Godot** – a personal project where I'm building the game I want to play. Relaxing, visually appealing, freedom without frustration. A place where I feel comfortable. It's set in **Siberia**, if you're curious.

## Books & Inspiration

I'm a sci-fi person at heart. **Isaac Asimov**, **Stephen King**, and **Clive Barker** shaped my imagination the most, along with Czech author Ondřej Neff and countless others. Space opera is my favorite genre – give me a good starship and I'm happy.

---

## Investing

As a developer, I have a decent income, and it felt wrong to let it just sit in a bank account. Plus, my wife is an economics engineer and I'm "just" a bachelor – so there's some healthy competitive pressure to not be financially illiterate. 📈

## Fun Facts (or: My Past Lives)

Here's where it gets interesting:

- ♟️ **Certified chess coach for children** – I was even the chairman of a chess club in Ostrava
- 🔫 **Military service** – mandatory back in the day
- 💰 **Security service** – transported money with a weapon, guarded chemical plants
- 🕵️ **Detective** – caught shoplifters in shopping malls
- 🏎️ **Advanced driving training** – crisis management, skid school, ice driving
- 📱 **Mobile phone repair** – managed a service center for a few years
- 🎮 **Worked for the world's largest adult entertainment company** (yes, *that* one) – developed games for one of their subsidiaries. Great icebreaker at parties.

## The Basics

I'm a father of two, which means my free time is... let's say *optimized*. When I'm not coding, studying, or working on my game, I'm probably playing chess, reading something smart (or at least pretending to), or spending time with family.
