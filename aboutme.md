Ammo for small talk.

Friends say I'm a fun guy (except when I'm not).

I like finance, investments, stocks, loans, economics and art. And **programming**, of course.

I've been looking at computers for over **twenty years** (what a long time, huh?).

My strengths are that I see things from a bigger picture, in the context of the business, I like to look outside the box,

I can quickly see bugs, flows, imperfections in a system, I'd like to focus on **performance** and user experience.

I hate routine, boring maintenance task, toxic culture and pessimistic persons. 

I like excitement, risk, challenges, new technologies, new processes, smart people and travel. 

I love to learn new things and I love to experiment.

I'm also father of two and beloved husband.
