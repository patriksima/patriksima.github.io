I'm a senior software engineer with **20+ years in IT**. I build scalable systems, lead technical teams, and optimize application performance. My experience spans enterprise solutions for automotive giants like VW Group/ŠKODA, e-commerce platforms, and financial systems. When I'm not architecting backends, I'm developing indie games in Godot or coaching young chess players.
